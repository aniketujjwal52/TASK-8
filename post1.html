    <h2>Exploring Nature</h2>
    <p>Nature is not just scenery — it's therapy. Walking through green forests, hiking in the mountains, and watching the stars away from city lights connects us back to who we really are. Whether it’s a weekend escape or a solo trip into the hills, nature always has something to teach us — patience, silence, and perspective.</p>
